Data Storage

-> The first most important thing is the 
	normal scienctific notation is different	
	in CS.
-> kilo in science is 1000 (10^3) in CS its 2^10 bytes
	or 1024 bytes.

-> The whole conversion system is:	|    storage is in Bytes(B)
	8 bit 	   = 1 bytes		|    dataspeed is in bits(b)
	1024 bytes = 1 Kilobyte		|
	1024 x 1024 = 1 Megabytes	|

-> And then this goes up to Exabytes which represent
	2^60 bytes.
