WORDSIZE

-> aka. wordlength
-> The number of bits that a computer
   (processor) can work with at a time.
-> The groups that a processor can
    use at a time are called words.
-> We usually use 64bit or 32bit.
-> The greater a wordsize is the more possible
    combinations can be stored.
-> So to check the amount of combinations we use:
	2^x = combinations
   or with 4 bits  ----->   2^4 = 16
