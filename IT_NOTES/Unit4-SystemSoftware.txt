Parts System Software
1) OS - Operating System
	-main software from which everything 
	 runs.
	- It contains the kernel.
	- The kernel controls IO to CPU.
	- THE OS PROVIDES
		- USER INTERFACE
		- LOAD and RUN PROGRAMS
		- Manage computer resources.
	
	1.1) USER INTERFACE
		- CLI - command line interface
		- GUI - graphical user interface	
		most operating systems use 
		WIMP
		Windows, Icons, Control and
		 pull down menus.
	
	1.2) Load and Run Programs
	1.3) Resource Management
		- IO -> controls all inputs 
			and outputs
			In - mouse, keyboard
			Out - Screens, sound
			      printers.
		- File Management
			create, save open
			move, delete files
			and other file stuff.
		- Memory Management
			RAM - make sure enough space is
			      allocated. 
		  	      and two programs dont 
			      share data.
		- Process Management

2)	DRIVERS
	- Drivers allow specific components 
	  to talk to the PC.
	- The control panel and task manager allow
	  the user to manage the drivers.
	- Drivers would do things like translate 
	  mouse movements into screen positions
	  or take a word document and encode the 
          data for the printer to print.

3) 	Programming Tools
	-  These are anything that allow us to develop or create
		programs or software.
	-  Usually these tools are the form of an IDE (intergated developement
		environment)
	-  An IDE is seperate from "terminal" development where the text editor,
	   compiling, running, and debugging are all different applications.

	3.1) Source Code vs Executable Code.
		- (src) original code written by a developer.
			in java its the *.java files.
		- (exe) this is the compiled version of the source code
			in java its a *.class
4) Utilities
	4.1) Defrag - Disk Defragmentation - cleans and rearranges info 
				on a hard disk.
	4.2) File Compression - Useful when trying to save or send 
				large files.


5) Software Distribution and Licencing
	-	Proprietary -> Need to pay for the software.
	-		Need to abide by the EULA 
				(End User Licence Agreement)
	- Free and Open Source Licences.
